                    <p className="text-base tracking-wide">Every artist begins with a blank canvas. A sketch. A vision. A moment of expression that deserves to be seen and remembered.</p>
                    <p className="text-base tracking-wide">But the digital world has changed the way art lives online. With every upload came new risks - work being copied, scraped, or lost in the noise of algorithms that valued clicks over creativity. Artists need more than a platform; they needed a safe home now more than anything.</p>
                    <p className="text-base tracking-wide">That's how artportal was born.</p>
                    <p className="text-base tracking-wide">We reimagined the digital art space, where an artist's portfolio could exist with the security it deserves, free from misuse and exploitation. A space where AI cannot strip away ownership, where every brushstroke, every design and every photograph remains firmly in the hands of its creator.</p>
                    <p className="text-base tracking-wide">But there is more to artportal than protection, it is a community driven environment for creators who believe in art's power to inspire, connect and embrace. Here, we hope you can grow connections and have those connections grow into opportunities.</p >
